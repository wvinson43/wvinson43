## Hi there !  **I am Wes Vinson.**  

## I am currently working on deepening my knowledge of Javascript (a life-long process).  I am also learning about how to contribute more widely via open source projects.  I'm looking to **collaborate** on any projects involving Angular, React, NodeJS, Javascript, or SQL.  I am always on the lookout for ways to **network** with others on the same paths.  

## Please **connect with me**:
